For this programmign assignment I used structs to create
the segment and side class. In these structs I included
the appropriate attributes.

I used an unordered_map to store all the data, with the side
being the key and the segment being the value

I had to remake the hash namespace since I was using 
an unordered map with my custom structs, and I 
also had to override the equals sign for my sign 
struct. 

I learned a lot about implementing a data structure
that uses a hash; it took me a while to realize that I 
had to change anything and kept wondering why it wasnt compiling

I also got a lot better at parsing stuff since 
I had to parse so many addresses. Overall I 
feel like I was able to grasp this programming assignment
and actually kind of enjoyed it.
